<p>Anyone who uses an electronic device might have noticed they have become better with time. How is this happening? Just to sprinkle a few keywords: Moore's law, VLSI, deep submicron, Artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning... and so on and on...</p>
<p>But if these words don't mean alien to you and you see what's going on in the transition from so-called computing age to the cognitive era. The information might be of some use to you or perhaps you can contribute to this collection.</p>
<p>As the chip complexity is growing so is the effort to meet the deadlines in an economic way. At the same time, another revolution is going on in understanding and implementing intelligent systems. Humans are humbled by powerful and intelligent (in narrow domains) systems. Machine learning is definitely showing results in several sectors, perhaps it's time to see how the semiconductor industry can benefit from it. This repository attempts to bring such developments into attention to busy engineers who are curious about what is going on at the forefront.</p>
<p>Keywords &quot;machine learning semiconductor&quot; in popular search engine gives <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/193054">paper published back in 1993 By KB Irani et al.</a>. This proves the concept is not new and definitely people in the industry were since long looking into machine learning to make efficient processes. A lot of publications can be found which proposed process optimization and fault detection automating the design process. Then what is this new revival and suddenly all conferences have started to have dedicated machine learning sections?
The best guess is probably due to media reporting success of deep neural networks. Plug in &quot;deep&quot; in any old architecture sprinkle new found knowledge such as &quot;ReLU&quot;, &quot;Batch norm&quot; or dropout and voila!! it seems to work much better. Not to mention the large datasets people put an effort into collecting.
If data was one part of it then thanks to gaming industry GPU helped to crunch that efficiently and let us try new designs to beat the records.</p>
<p>If we make placing blocks or floorplanning a game with the reward given by fastest to finish the job with least violations and least area consumed, no one can say for sure if folks over deepmind will not be able to make some version of &quot;Alpha&quot; to beat the records.</p>
<p>This is indeed possible thanks to closed loop problem where we have tools to define the environment, a well-defined rewards system and of course powerful machines to run the show. How good this will get only time can tell but if it ever happens then we will have systems which will have the power to evaluate every move of designer and tell/advice/augment her/him about the possible outcome of that move.</p>
<p>For now, let us contribute to this fascinating field and keep our eyes open to developments happening around the globe.</p>
