# Artificial Intelligence / Machine learning online courses.

There are several excellent resources spread over the internet, and it is hard to be objective to say what are the best ones. However as starting point here are some of them

- [ Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?), it is fantastic place where you can benefit from several courses on AI / ML .
- [ CS231n ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfnWJUyUJYU&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC), if you want to delve into image processing this is a great course to follow.
- [ Deepmind ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ), watch David giving fantastic course on reinforcement learning.
- [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/)
- [Caltech](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html)
- [Oxford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV80NAlEins&list=PLE6Wd9FR--EfW8dtjAuPoTuPcqmOV53Fu)

and many many more ..
All the above courses are world class and great to start with rather than finding the best course probably starting with anyone of these is great!

# Books

Again there are so many to choose from. But to get quick start for result oriented folks and those with some what experience can take these resources. Else pick up any book you find on this topic and it will start your journey and quickly you'll pick up what meets your need.

- [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/), Despite the title of only deep learning please have a look in this freely available book. A great resource from the experts, especially part I should be read by anyone interested in the field. Its mathematical but very much needed if you intend to do anything serious.

- [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow ](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwiPwvjEuoHhAhWjvO0KHcDDBrEYABAHGgJkZw&sig=AOD64_3zTY2sGRqKz8v3HfFXNonqK472Qw&ctype=5&q=&ved=0ahUKEwjzo_HEuoHhAhUONOwKHYaGCGoQ9aACCDg&adurl=), great book to start with and it holds your hands in getting you to the results.

- [ PRML](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738), a well known book covering topics in great depth. Though you may not find it addressing the latest headline algorithms but a must read for in depth knowledge.

# Should we go on..

Well as these are just few books to get started one can never list or read all that is available. Pick anyone and don't miss out Python, but since you are up to here it is safe to assume that you are aware of benefits of python.

# Books on VLSI + machine learning.

As of start 2019 there are not so many books on this topic but lets see whats out there.

- [Machine Learning in VLSI Computer-Aided Design](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783030046651), This book is the latest to be found by searching online.
- [Machine Intelligence in Design Automation ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1980554358/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=paripath-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1980554358&linkId=8825de695f454197eef54591b61f5b3e).

# Some interesting papers.

There are so many publications out there that it's impossible to list all of them, also it is not necessary. However to get started and start back tracking or to explore citation graph, lets start with few.

- [Machine Learning Applications in Physical Design: Recent Results and Directions](https://doi.org/10.1145/3177540.3177554)

- [Training a Fully Convolutional Neural Network to Route Integrated Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08948)
- [LEAP: A learning apprentice for VLSI design](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978008051055250016X) This one is has over 400 citations and is now almost 30 year old!

# Research groups and academic centers

- [CENTER FOR ADVANCED ELECTRONICS THROUGH MACHINE LEARNING (CAEML)](https://publish.illinois.edu/advancedelectronics/)

# Tools to get started

1. [Get python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. [Make virtual environment](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/)
3. Install all the packages you love. But definitely check out [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html) and [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) . Remember pip is your friend.
4. Install [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

5. Start new notebook and of you go.. in due time you'll be hopefully serving your models with tensoflow serving and running gigantic nerual nets for designing next chips !

I'm not familiar with R but surely many folks appreciate it and if you already know R then I'm sure you are not reading this, instead you already have RStudio fired up.
