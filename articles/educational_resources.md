# Artificial Intelligence / Machine learning online courses.

There are several excellent resources spread over the internet, and it is hard to be objective to say what are the best ones. However as starting point here are some of them

- [ Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?), it is fantastic place where you can benefit from several courses on AI / ML .
- [ CS231n ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfnWJUyUJYU&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC), if you want to delve into image processing this is a great course to follow.
- [ Deepmind ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ), watch David giving fantastic course on reinforcement learning.

# Books

Again there are so many to choose from. But to get quick start for result oriented folks and those with some what experience can take these resources. Else pick up any book you find on this topic and it will start your journey and quickly you'll pick up what meets your need.

- [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow ](https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwiPwvjEuoHhAhWjvO0KHcDDBrEYABAHGgJkZw&sig=AOD64_3zTY2sGRqKz8v3HfFXNonqK472Qw&ctype=5&q=&ved=0ahUKEwjzo_HEuoHhAhUONOwKHYaGCGoQ9aACCDg&adurl=), great book to start with and it holds your hands in getting you to the results.

- [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/), Despite the title of only deep learning please have a look in this freely available book. A great resource from the experts, especially part I should be read by anyone interested in the field. Its mathematical but very much needed if you intend to do anything serious.

- [ PRML](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738), a well known book covering topics in great depth. Though you may not find it addressing the latest headline algorithms but a must read for in depth knowledge.

# Should we go on..

Well as these are just few books to get started one can never list or read all that is available. Pick anyone and don't miss out Python, but since you are up to here it is safe to assume that you are aware of benefits of python.

# Books on VLSI + machine learning.

As of start 2019 there are not so many books on this topic but lets see whats out there.

- [Machine Learning in VLSI Computer-Aided Design](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783030046651), This book is the latest to be found by searching online.
