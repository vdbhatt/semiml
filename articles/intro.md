# Keeping track of AI + Semiconductor

Everyone who uses any electronic device might have noticed they have become better with time. How is this happening. Just to sprinkle few keywords : Moore's law, VLSI, deep sub micron , Artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning... and so on and on..

But if these words don't mean alien to you and you see whats going on in transition from so called computing age to cognitive era. The information might be of some use to you or perhaps you can contribute to this collection.

As the chip complexity is growing so is the effort to meet the deadlines in economic way. At the same time another revolution is going on in understanding and implementing intelligent systems. Humans are humbled by powerful and intelligent (in narrow domains) systems. Machine learning is definitely showing results in several sectors, perhaps it's time to see how the semiconductor industry can benefit from it. This repository is attempts to bring such developments into attention to busy engineers who are curious about what is going on at the forefront.
